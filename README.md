# Counteract

Welcome to the repository for Counteract, a crowdsourced risk analysis platform
for sending nice messages to people who may be having a bad day or show signs of mental illness. This project will soon be made open source.

##Info:
We utilized SVM Classification on public tweets to classify tweets as happy/sad, then a Markov chain on encouraging tweets to generate a happy message to tweet at the person who tweeted something sad.
